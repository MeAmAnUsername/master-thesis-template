\chapter{\label{chap:problem_analysis}Problem analysis}

TODO: In this chapter:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use case: Spoofax pipelines
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is language development?
    \item What is Spoofax? (also explains the Spoofax Ecosystem, e.g. SDF3, NaBL2, Statix, Stratego)
    \item What are pipelines that we want to express with the PIE DSL?
  \end{itemize}
  \item More detailed explanations of the problems
\end{itemize}

PIE framework exists and is in active development.
It is implemented in Java so there is lots of boilerplate.

To resolve this, the PIE DSL avoids the boilerplate and adds language support for domain specific elements, e.g. paths, list comprehensions.
It still has room for improvement:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item cannot compile to Java
  \item cannot generate tasks with a dependency on something other than a task
  \item cannot compose PIE files
  \item cannot interface with Java generic classes
\end{enumerate}
