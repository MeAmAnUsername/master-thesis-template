PIE framework exists and is in active development.
It is implemented in Java so there is lots of boilerplate.

To resolve this, the PIE DSL avoids the boilerplate and adds language support for domain specific elements, e.g. paths, list comprehensions.
It still has room for improvement:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item cannot compile to Java
  \item cannot generate tasks with a dependency on something other than a task
  \item cannot compose PIE files
  \item cannot interface with Java generic classes
\end{enumerate}
