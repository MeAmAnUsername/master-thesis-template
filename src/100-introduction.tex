\todo{short introduction: what is PIE?}

Using the PIE framework requires a lot of boilerplate.
To mediate this, the PIE DSL is a DSL to specify PIE pipelines.
It compiles to Java.
The PIE DSL was created by GabriÃ«l Konat in \todo{reference} as part of his work on the PIE framework.
This included a compiler from PIE DSL to Kotlin.
For various reasons compiling to Kotlin was deemed undesirable, so Ivo Wilms implemented a compiler from the DSL to Java \todo{is there a reference? If not: add footnote to explain why}.

The PIE DSL was not [powerful|expressive|extensive] enough to be used in many real world use cases.
The Java compiler implemented by used string interpolation, which (as it turned out) is "suboptimal" \footnote{it's severely limiting, don't do it}.

Problems:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Existing compilers are not satisfactory
  \begin{itemize}
     \item Compiler to Kotlin is outdated, compiling to Kotlin is undesirable.
     \item Compiler to Java compiles via string interpolation, which is very limiting.
   \end{itemize}
  \item Single file only (does not scale to multi-language project setups)
  \item Expressiveness
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item No way to express core concepts of PIE, e.g. Suppliers and Results
    \item No way to declare injected values for tasks
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Objectives
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solve these problems
  \item Keep the PIE DSL general
  \begin{itemize}
    \item It could also compile to another language if another compiler and PIE framework were written in that language.
    \item It should work for pipelines in general, not just Spoofax pipelines.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement a compiler that compiles to Java using Java ASTs
  \item Implement a module system
  \item Extend the old PIE DSL with new constructs
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Add generics
    \item (If adding generics fails) Add \inlinecode{supplier<T>} construct
    \item Add context parameters construct
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item new compiler
  \item implemented static semantics in Statix
  \item Add modules, context parameters (and generics?) to the PIE DSL
  \item Evaluate the new DSL in three case studies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item simple transformation from Tiger
    \item database pipelines at Oracle
    \item testing pipelines at Oracle
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
